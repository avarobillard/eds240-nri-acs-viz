# Visualizing FEMA NRI Data

Author: Ava Robillard

This repository contains a visualization of how [FEMA (Federal Emergency Management Agency)](https://www.fema.gov/about) [National Risk Index (NRI)](https://www.fema.gov/flood-maps/products-tools/national-risk-index) scores for counties in California compare to those in other states, created in R using the {ggplot2} package. The National Risk Index dataset provides information for communities most at risk to 18 different natural hazards. It offers a baseline risk measurement for expected annual loss, social vulnerability and community resilience at the Census tract or county level (FEMA, 2025).
